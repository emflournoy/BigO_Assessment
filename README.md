# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    > Big-O notation helps describe the relative efficiency as a function of the size of the input. It deals with the worst case scenario of each algorithm. The code could run faster, but the point of it is to show the slowest scenarioq

 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    > time and space

---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    > b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

---



4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   > Binary Search

---



5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    > O(n log n)

---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    > O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
      O(n) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
      O(n^2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    > typically the choice of the next element on which to perform some action is one of several possibilities, and only one will need to be chosen.
